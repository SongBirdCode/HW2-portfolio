# Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio 

## Description

 For this challenge, I was tasked to create a portfolio utilizing flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables following the Acceptance Criteria within the reference gif given.

 As we learn and grow and add our projects we can add them here and will help us for future workplace opportunity references. 

 Our class was informed slight adjustments such as different photos or color varients are allowed. 


## Installation
 
 I created from scratch semantic HTML elements, wrote notes for every section I used. 
 Ensure flex and over all content was functional, continued to adjust as needed.
 Once all HTML outline requirements were met and matched, I moved into assigning appropriate CSS. 
 I did a few tests to ensure I would have the color and font outlines as is noted then moved forward to assigning it as my root. Website has been tested and links functional as per requirements of assignment.

 References are enclosed for Requirement and Outcome viewing.
